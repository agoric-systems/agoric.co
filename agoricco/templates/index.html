            <h1>The Agoric Vision</h1>
            <p>We Agorians see value transmission as a fundamental human right. In the form of money, it is simply the act of transferring a form of potential energy from one entity to the next; be it an institution, person, or autonomous system. Although this is not technically potential energy by scientific terms, money is akin to potential energy in that its influence is able to open the doors and opportunities of the world up to those who have it. Modern society is normalized into believing in the myth of money without ever questioning “Why is it this way?” or “Where does it come from?” The truth of the matter is that existing fiat money systems are quite arbitrary. They are currently useful because of their widespread adoption, yet flawed in more ways than one. We the people can’t openly verify that our society is functioning correct and fairly. Nor are we able to escape the captured networks of arbitrary fees, delays, seizures, and fines.</p>

            <p><strong>But there is a better way.</strong> Humanity finally has the tools to create faster and fairer monetary systems, exchanges, governance structures, voting systems, and settlement layers. Decentralized Autonomous Communities are springing into existence, stigmergic swarms of people expressing value to each other, collaborating, and socializing, and in general interacting in many different forms. Now, today, communities are creating brand new business models and unlocking agoric opportunities for people to earn their keep in this world. People are opting out of the traditional economy and joining a new one— the digital economy.</p>

            <p>At Agoric, we believe in solving the challenges of humanity, by adopting socio-economic systems that align with our values, and sharing those systems and values with the wider world. We have personally derived great benefit from participating in the nascent digital economy already; dividends of knowledge, collaboration, relationships, tokens— all units of intrinsic value that we’ve shared and had shared with us.</p>

            <p>We hope you will join us in in our endeavor to reconfigure society into an accessible and equitable, prosperous and beautiful landscape for all of the people on Earth.</p>

            <h1>Witness Proposal</h1>
            <p>Collectively, our crew has already introduced Steem, Graphene, and blockchain technology to hundreds of people, and we’re just getting started! We aspire to become an active witness in cooperation with the Steem community, and in support of our core goals:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>To provide reliable infrastructure for Steem and other Graphene-based blockchain networks; e.g. helping to further develop and expand the witness toolset for maintaining operational infrastructure, providing price feeds, and acting as an oracle.</li>
              <li>To build our team’s collective influence on the network and leverage that influence for greater works, such as bringing more people to the platform, and in support of our other core goals.</li>
              <li>To create products and services that will support Steem and the overall Graphene ecosystem by maintaining a responsive product development pipeline.</li>
              <li>To run educational workshops in our local communities that will onboard more users to Steem, and help to amplify its existing network effect.</li>
              <li>To translate earned digital value into physical works as a testament to the power of distributed autonomous communities. We have ambitious goals, such as creating the first Steem-powered neighborhood in Detroit.</li>
              <li>To create inspiring and engaging media, further expanding the many communities of which the Graphene ecosystem is comprised.</li>
